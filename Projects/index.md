[Garcia et al 2014](a-study-guide.md)

My first ever attempt at creating something. The idea was to take a complex paper that had important concepts and make those concepts understandable to the non-expert with a little bit of guidance and clarification.

[SpamBase Modeling Process and Evaluation](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/bdjulian/bdjulian.github.io/blob/main/Projects/spam-minilab.ipynb)

Here is a jupyter notebook where I proceed through extremely simple modeling processes with a focus on model evaluation to include Partial Dependence Plots and SHAP Values.
It is written in a casual explanatory tone.
The notebook pulls the Spambase dataset from openML so data is not needed locally to run the notebook.
