For the purpose of my own learning and general aversion to boredom, I will go cover to cover of _Bayesian Statistics The Fun Way_, by Will Kurt. I'm going to keep a record of things I struggle with while going cover to cover while also generating use cases as to why knowing bayesian stats is useful for someone working in a Data Science capacity. There may be no necessity to know bayesian statistics or more than its fundamentals... But either way I'll learn something.
