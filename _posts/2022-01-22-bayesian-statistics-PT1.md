# Starting Bayesian Statistics the Fun Way, by Will Kurt

## What is Bayesian Statistics?
So far, this is something I can comprehend on my own. However, since I have had a hard time figuring out how to explain the difference between Bayesian stats and frequentist stats without immediately quoting Will Kurt or another more experienced statistician. I can't say I fully comprehend it. You don't fully understand something until you can teach it right?

## What is Frequentist Stats?
The frequentist approach to stats is all about frequencies, distributions, and the law of large numbers. Taking the coin flip, if a fair coin is flipped an infinite number of times, one can expect to get an equal number of heads and tails. Or a probability of getting a heads (or tails) being .5 per flip based on this observed frequency. And therefore the fair coin flip has a binomial distribution of outcomes over infinite coin flips. The reason all of the infinities are important (law of large numbers) is that frequentist statistics only applies probabilities to repeated events observed over long periods of time.[^1]

But now how does any of this help us guess the probability that our favorite actress wins best actress at the Oscars this year?
