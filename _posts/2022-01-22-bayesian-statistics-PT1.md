# Starting Bayesian Statistics the Fun Way, by Will Kurt

So far this is an awesome book and I am looking forward to the rest, be sure to check it out.

In order to help myself understand some of the initial topics brought forward in literally the opening chapters of the book, I had to go out and research the formal definition of frequentist statistics.

## What is Frequentist Stats?
The frequentist approach to stats is all about frequencies, distributions, and the law of large numbers. Taking the coin flip, if a fair coin is flipped an infinite number of times, one can expect to get an equal number of heads and tails. Or a probability of getting a heads (or tails) being .5 per flip based on this observed frequency. And therefore the fair coin flip has a binomial distribution of outcomes over infinite coin flips. The reason all of the infinities are important (law of large numbers) is that frequentist statistics only applies probabilities to repeated events observed over long periods of time.[^1] And it's in this area that frequentism is apparently very different from Bayesian stats.

## What is Bayesian Statistics?
So far, this is something I can comprehend on my own. However, since I have had a hard time figuring out how to explain the difference between Bayesian stats and frequentist stats without immediately quoting Will Kurt or another more experienced statistician. I can't say I fully comprehend it. You don't fully understand something until you can teach it right?

I'll leave it up to Kurt here -

>Bayesian statistics, on the other hand, is concerned with how probabilities represent how uncertain we are about a piece of information. In Bayesian
terms, if the probability of getting heads in a coin toss is 0.5, that means we
are equally unsure about whether we’ll get heads or tails. For problems like
coin tosses, both frequentist and Bayesian approaches seem reasonable, but
when you’re quantifying your belief that your favorite candidate will win the
next election, the Bayesian interpretation makes much more sense. (Kurt 21)

Kurt does a pretty good job at introducing Bayesian statistics, and how the general thought process of Bayesian stats in pretty in tune with normal logical reasoning.
I really like the example of an election, there are no real previous elections to help predict the outcome here (unless this is a second term something) but for examples sake, we'd be predicting the outcome of an election based on all the prior data collected during campaigns. Things like policies, primaries, T.V. appearances, pop culture knowledge, etc. would all influence the conditional probability of an election type event. This example, for me, clearly separates what is a Bayesian thought process from a frequentist problem. In election type events there may not always be a frequency distribution or repeated events to pull a probability from.

This comparison ends it here and covers the one crucial detail of the first chapter without going into some of the basic math exercises Kurt does to put probabilities into equations.
